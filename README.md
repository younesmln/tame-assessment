# A tame-driven JS challenge

This repo includes a set of tests to the test JavaScript skills, or as a brain workout. :bowtie:

### Get started
You can clone or download this repo. Once you have done so, from the root
directory of the repo, run:

    npm install
    npm start

You can then view the tests in your browser at and you will find the instructions there
described by the tests
[http://localhost:4444](http://localhost:4444).

When you visit that page, all of the tests should be failing; your job is to
get the tests to pass. To do this, you'll need to refer to the tests in the
files in the `tests/app` directory, and edit the files in the `app/` directory.
Once you update a test, you can reload the test page in the browser to see
whether it worked. **and don't change the tests folder!**

### Available dependencies

The repo includes jQuery, Backbone, and Underscore. You can use these
libraries when writing your solutions! **and only these!**

### Data-driven tests

If your tests need data that can be fetched via XHR, stick a `.json` file in
the `data` directory; you can access it at `/data/<filename>.json`.
